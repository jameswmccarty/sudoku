Rules

1. Fill in the cells under the following rules.
2. You cannot fill in cells containing numbers.
3. A number tells the number of continuous white cells. Each area of white cells contains only one number in it and they are separated by black cells.
4. The black cells are linked to be a continuous wall.
5. Black cells cannot be linked to be 2Ã—2 square or larger.

Can complete 10x10 in a around a minute with pypy3.  Still too slow for 12x12 and larger.
